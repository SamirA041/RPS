Rock, Paper, Scissors
Planning
In this section, I will provide a brief overview of the project and outline the steps to achieve my goal.

Project Overview
The objective is to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. My approach involves creating an input area for the user's choice and developing three functions to handle each possible move.

Functions Pseudocode
User Picks Rock
If the computer picks scissors, the user wins.
If the computer picks paper, the user loses.
This logic can be adapted similarly for the other moves (paper and scissors).
